This file was able to successfully take an input folder that the user downloaded and process it through the application, which was then able to read and process the input folder to filter data and create unique output files within an output folder directory which was also made 
by the user. This created databases based on all of the unique 'state' and 'vehicle make' combinations of all vehicles and states that were located in the input folder. The format of data was exactly as expected in the format of:
{'Zip Code', '2010', '2011', '2012', ..... '2021', '2022', '2023', '2024'}, as the years were based on what was found in the input folder, varying from vehicle to vehicle and state to state.
