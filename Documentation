This file was able to successfully take an input folder that the user downloaded and process it through the application, which was then able to read and process the input folder to filter data and create unique output files within an output folder directory which was also made 
by the user. This created databases based on all of the unique 'state' and 'vehicle make' combinations of all vehicles and states that were located in the input folder. The format of data was exactly as expected in the format of:
{'Zip Code', '2010', '2011', '2012', ..... '2021', '2022', '2023', '2024'}, as the years were based on what was found in the input folder, varying from vehicle to vehicle and state to state. 

Here is the code that was used to make this application using Python:

'''
This program extracts Microsoft Excel CSV databases from an input folder created by the user 
that saves the new, filtered data to an output folder directory selected by the user. Databases
are created for every vehicle based on their make and state. These classifications are used to 
determine the total verhicle registrations across every zip code in the state for a 
particular vehicle make over the course of the years in which they appear in with every 
file found in the input_folder_path.
